# Backstory
A few weeks ago on r/web_dev there was a post offering to critique UX for folks essentially free of cost. I myself have often gotten stuck, where either SO and other Q and A type of avenues cannot sufficiently address the predicament. While we have [hackerhands](https://www.pluralsight.com/hackhands) / [airpair](https://airpair.com) / [codementor](https://www.codementor.io), this list is meant to be an indie hacker friendly collaborative list :-) to connect those who have some cyles to spare and maybe get some $$ as a result while helping the indie hacker community do better.
